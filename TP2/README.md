## Project information

- Main Strong Points
  - Optimized keyframe animation and text loading
  - Use of setActiveShaderSimple() for speed improvement
  - Clean structure, maintainable code
  - Large default error coverage
  - [Documentation](https://web.fe.up.pt/~up201909936/laig/TP2/out/)
- Scene
  - The scene starts with a game console loading with two characters dancing and after the console rotates, the scene from the first project appears on the game console screen. After that, there's a bongo being played in a wooden floor also on the game console screen. Finally, the game console flies away from the screen and we arrive at the end of the scene with a positive message("Trump was ejected :)").
